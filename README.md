# ASPNETCoreDockerMicroservices
Sample project for getting off the ground with ASP.NET Core, Docker and Microservices based on the tutorial: https://fullstackmark.com/post/12/get-started-building-microservices-with-asp.net-core-and-docker-in-visual-studio-code

This repo contains the demo project used as the subject for a blog post I did on getting started with ASP.NET Core-based microservices and Docker.

It should be fairly cross-platform friendly to get up and running but was developed on my windows 10 machine along with the following:

- Windows 10
- Visual Studio Code - v1.19.0
    - C# for Visual Studio Code extension
    - Docker extension
 - SQL Server Management Studio 17.4
- .NET Core SDK v2.0.0
- Docker Community Edition 17.09.1-ce-win42

# Setup
